# Glossaries

## Tools and Technology

```{glossary}
[Binder](https://mybinder.org)
  A free, public service for running reproducible interactive computing
  environments. Binder is a 100% open source infrastructure that is run by
  members of the Jupyter community. The underlying technology behind the Binder
  project is BinderHub.

[BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io)
  The underlying technology of mybinder.org, BinderHub is an open source tool
  that utilizes a JupyterHub`= in order to provide live, reproducible
  interactive computing environments that users define on GitHub.

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io)
  Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R,
  Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN, and more.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely
  isolated environment called a container. It is widely used for creating
  reproducible software environments to run code on different computers.

[Git](https://git-scm.com)
  A popular version control system that is used in many open source software
  projects to manage their software code base.

[GitHub](https://github.com)
  Provider of Internet hosting for software development and distributed version
  control using the "git" command line tool.

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
  Project Jupyter (name derived from "JUlia PYThon and R") exists to develop
  open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing
  across dozens of programming languages.

[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
  Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful,
  publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io)
  A core open source tool from the Jupyter community, JupyterHub allows you to
  deploy an application that provides remote data science environments to
  multiple users. It can be deployed in the cloud, or on your own hardware.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io)
  JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
  intended to replace the JupyterNotebook interface.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyterbook.org)
  open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that
  contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

[MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io)
  Markedly Structured Text (MyST) is a rich and extensible flavor of Markdown
  meant for technical documentation and publishing. It is used by Jupyter Book.

## Topical (Use Case Specific)
```{glossary}
[basal slip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_sliding)
  Basal slip or sliding is the act of a glacier sliding over the bed due to meltwater 
  under the ice acting as a lubricant. This movement very much depends on the 
  temperature of the area, the slope of the glacier, the bed roughness, the amount of 
  meltwater from the glacier, and the glacier's size. 

[subglacial water/lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subglacial_lake)
 A subglacial lake is a lake that is found under a glacier, typically beneath an ice
 cap or ice sheet. Subglacial lakes form at the boundary between ice and the 
 underlying bedrock, where gravitational pressure decreases the pressure melting
 point of ice.[1][2] Over time, the overlying ice gradually melts at a rate of a few
 millimeters per year.[3] Meltwater flows from regions of high to low hydraulic
 pressure under the ice and pools, creating a body of liquid water that can be
 isolated from the external environment for millions of years.
